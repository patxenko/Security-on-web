This is a proof of concept webpage that uses some security measures.

Integrated tools are as follows:

Latch: Pair-Unpair web account with the latch app, open and close the latches with your app so you can block or release your account access.

Google Authenticator: Scan a QR code with your movile device and Google Authenticator app, to pair your account with Google Authenticator. Enable/disable your account with Google Authenticator for TOTP (Time-based One Time Password) access.

Facebook Login: Facebook Login to the main profile page using facebook API.

Twittter Login: Login with twitter to the main profile page using twitter API.

This project is being done locally. To test it, you must change the access to your local database and create the appropriate databases (look the php files to see how it is done) , as well as create a developer account when necessary for latch, facebook and twitter to use it for your own application.
